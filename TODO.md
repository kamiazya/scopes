# Scopes Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for Scopes, following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. We start with the domain layer and application layer to establish a solid foundation for the system.

## Project Vision

**Scopes** is a next-generation local-first task and project management tool designed for symbiotic collaboration between developers and AI assistants. The core innovation is the unified "Scope" entity - a single recursive concept that replaces traditional project/epic/task hierarchies.

## Architecture Approach

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with dependency rules pointing inward
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models encapsulating business logic
- **Local-First**: Offline-capable with selective synchronization
- **AI-Native**: Designed for human-AI collaboration from the ground up

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Domain Layer üöÄ

#### 1.1 Value Objects
- [ ] `ScopeId`: ULID-based identifier
- [ ] `ScopeTitle`: Title with validation rules
- [ ] `ScopeDescription`: Rich text description
- [ ] `ScopeStatus`: Lifecycle states (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed ‚Üí logged)

### Phase 3: Repository Interfaces

- [ ] `ScopeRepository`
      ```typescript
        - save(scope: Scope): Promise<void>
        - findById(id: ScopeId): Promise<Scope?>
        - findByParent(parentId: ScopeId): Promise<Scope[]>
        - findAll(): Promise<Scope[]>
        - delete(id: ScopeId): Promise<void>
      ```

- [ ] `AspectRepository`
      ```typescript
        - saveAspects(scopeId: ScopeId, aspects: Aspect[]): Promise<void>
        - findByScopeId(scopeId: ScopeId): Promise<Aspect[]>
        - removeAspect(scopeId: ScopeId, key: AspectKey): Promise<void>
      ```

- [ ] Specification Pattern
      - [ ] `ScopeSpecification` interface
      - [ ] `AspectSpecification` for complex queries

## Testing Strategy

### Domain Layer Testing
- Pure unit tests with no external dependencies
- Business rule validation
- Entity state transitions
- Value object equality and immutability

### Application Layer Testing
- Use case workflow testing
- Mocked repository implementations
- Error handling scenarios
- Integration between use cases

### Test Coverage Goals
- Domain Layer: 100% coverage
- Application Layer: 90%+ coverage
- Focus on business-critical paths

## Technical Considerations

### Language Selection (Pending)
- Currently evaluating Kotlin for type safety and domain modeling
- Design patterns are language-agnostic
- Interfaces prepared for dependency injection

### Development Principles
- Interface-based design for flexibility
- Immutability by default for value objects
- Factory methods for complex object creation
- Repository pattern for persistence abstraction
