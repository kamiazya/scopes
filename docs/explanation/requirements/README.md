# Scopes Requirements Specification

This directory contains the functional and non-functional requirements for the Scopes system. Each requirement is documented as a separate file to enable focused discussion and tracking.

## Project Overview

**Scopes** is a next-generation local-first task and project management tool designed for symbiotic collaboration between developers and AI assistants.

**Primary Goal**: Eliminate context loss and maximize productivity through a unified, recursive task management system that enables seamless human-AI collaboration.
