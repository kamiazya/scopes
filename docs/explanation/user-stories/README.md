# Scopes User Stories

This directory contains user stories that describe how different personas interact with the Scopes system. Each story captures a specific user need and desired outcome, providing the foundation for requirements and implementation decisions.

## Purpose

User stories help us:
- **Understand user needs** before defining technical requirements
- **Prioritize features** based on real user value
- **Design workflows** that match natural user behavior
- **Validate requirements** against actual use cases
- **Maintain user focus** during development

## User Personas

### Primary Personas

Our target users and their key characteristics:

| Persona | Description | Key Needs | Pain Points |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **AI-Driven Developer** | Uses AI assistants as primary development partners | Context preservation, seamless AI handoff | Context loss during long sessions, manual AI briefing |
| **Tech Lead** | Manages design quality before team presentation | Local design refinement, selective sharing | External tool complexity, double data entry |
| **OSS Contributor** | Contributes to multiple international projects | Multi-project context switching, language support | Language barriers, project confusion |
| **Multi-Device Developer** | Works across laptop, desktop, remote servers | Seamless device switching, offline capability | Context preservation across devices |
| **International Engineer** | Works in foreign companies or OSS projects | Language bridging, cultural context | Communication barriers, tool localization |

### Secondary Personas

| Persona | Description | Context |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Solo Developer** | Individual working on personal/small projects | Needs simplicity over collaboration features |
| **Remote Team Member** | Part of distributed development team | Needs asynchronous collaboration capabilities |
| **CLI Tool User** | General developer using command-line tools | Expects standard CLI conventions and behavior |

## OOS CLI Tool Considerations

As an open-source CLI tool, Scopes must address standard expectations:

### Installation & Setup
- Package manager installation (npm, brew, cargo, etc.)
- Manual installation from releases
- First-run configuration and setup
- Version compatibility and updates

### Standard CLI Behaviors
- Help system and documentation
- Configuration management
- Error handling and user feedback
- Shell integration and completion
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Community & Maintenance
- Issue reporting and debugging
- Community contribution workflows
- Release management and distribution
- Documentation and tutorials

## Implementation Approach

User stories will be created iteratively based on:

1. **Core functionality needs** - Essential features for MVP
2. **User feedback and validation** - Real user testing results
3. **Technical constraints** - Implementation feasibility
4. **Community input** - OSS community requirements

Each story will be documented using the provided template and linked here as it's created.

## Success Criteria

Each user story is considered successful when:

### User Experience Validation
- ✅ **User can complete the workflow** without external help
- ✅ **Workflow feels natural** and matches user expectations
- ✅ **Time-to-value is minimized** for the specific use case
- ✅ **Error recovery is intuitive** when things go wrong

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ **All acceptance criteria pass** automated testing
- ✅ **Performance meets user expectations** for the workflow
- ✅ **Integration points work smoothly** with dependent systems
- ✅ **Edge cases are handled gracefully** without user frustration

### OSS Community Standards
- ✅ **Installation is straightforward** across platforms
- ✅ **Documentation is complete and accessible**
- ✅ **Community can contribute effectively**
- ✅ **Tool follows CLI conventions** and best practices

## Traceability to Requirements

User stories flow into functional requirements through this process:

1. **Story Analysis**: Extract technical capabilities needed
2. **Requirement Definition**: Define system behavior to enable the story
3. **Acceptance Mapping**: Ensure requirements satisfy story acceptance criteria
4. **Implementation Tracking**: Verify story completion through requirement fulfillment

## Contributing to User Stories

When creating or updating user stories:

1. **Focus on user value** - What benefit does the user get?
2. **Be specific** - Include concrete examples and scenarios
3. **Consider constraints** - What limitations does the user face?
4. **Think end-to-end** - Cover the complete user journey
5. **Validate with personas** - Does this match real user behavior?
6. **Consider OSS context** - Address open-source tool expectations
7. **Link to requirements** - Ensure traceability to technical specifications
