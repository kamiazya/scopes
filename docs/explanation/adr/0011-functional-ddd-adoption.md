# ADR-0011: Functional Domain-Driven Design Adoption

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Scopes project has successfully adopted Domain-Driven Design (ADR-0007) and Clean Architecture (ADR-0008) as foundational architectural patterns. While these provide strong structural guidance, our current implementation relies heavily on object-oriented paradigms with imperative error handling through exceptions.

As we scale the complexity of our domain logic, several challenges have emerged:

1. **Mutable State Management**: Object-oriented domain models can introduce subtle bugs through shared mutable state
2. **Exception-Based Error Handling**: Current exception propagation makes error scenarios harder to reason about and test
3. **Complex Business Logic Composition**: Combining multiple domain operations requires careful state management
4. **Testing Complexity**: Side effects in domain logic make unit testing more complex
5. **Concurrent Access**: Mutable domain objects require careful synchronization in concurrent scenarios

Functional programming paradigms offer solutions to these challenges through immutability, pure functions, and explicit error handling. Kotlin's excellent functional programming support makes this transition feasible while maintaining our existing Clean Architecture structure.

## Decision

We will adopt **Functional Domain-Driven Design (Functional DDD)** principles within our existing Clean Architecture framework. This approach combines DDD's strategic design patterns with functional programming's tactical implementation patterns.

### Core Principles

1. **Immutable Domain Objects**: All domain entities, value objects, and aggregates will be immutable
2. **Pure Functions for Business Logic**: Domain services and operations will be implemented as pure functions without side effects
3. **Explicit Error Handling**: Replace exception-based error handling with Result/Either types for explicit error representation
4. **Function Composition**: Complex domain operations will be built through composing smaller, focused functions
5. **Domain Events as Data**: Domain events will be represented as immutable data structures

### Implementation Strategy

- **Sealed Classes for Domain Modeling**: Use Kotlin's sealed classes for representing domain states and commands
- **Result Types**: Implement Result<T, E> or Either<L, R> types for explicit error handling
- **Pure Domain Services**: Domain services will be stateless functions that operate on immutable data
- **Functional Repository Patterns**: Repository operations will return Result types instead of throwing exceptions
- **Event Sourcing Preparation**: Domain events will be designed as immutable data structures suitable for event sourcing

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reduced Bugs**: Immutable data structures eliminate entire classes of bugs related to shared mutable state
- **Better Testability**: Pure functions are deterministic and easier to test with clear input/output relationships
- **Explicit Error Handling**: Result types make error scenarios visible in the type system and force proper handling
- **Composability**: Pure functions can be easily composed to build complex business logic
- **Concurrent Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe
- **Reasoning**: Functional code is often easier to reason about due to lack of hidden state mutations
- **Documentation**: Function signatures with Result types serve as documentation of possible outcomes

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with functional programming may need time to adapt
- **Memory Overhead**: Immutable data structures may require more memory for large datasets
- **Performance Considerations**: Creating new objects instead of mutating existing ones may impact performance in some scenarios
- **Library Ecosystem**: Some existing libraries may not align well with functional paradigms
- **Migration Effort**: Existing code will need gradual refactoring to align with functional principles

### Neutral

- **Code Style Change**: Different patterns and idioms compared to traditional OOP approaches
- **Type System Usage**: Heavier reliance on Kotlin's type system for encoding business rules

## Alternatives Considered

### Object-Oriented DDD (Current Approach)
Traditional OOP-based DDD with mutable entities and exception-based error handling. Rejected because it doesn't address our concerns about state management and error handling complexity.

### Anemic Domain Model
Moving all business logic to service layers with simple data containers. Rejected because it violates DDD principles and doesn't provide the benefits of functional programming.

### Procedural Approach
Implementing domain logic as simple procedural functions without DDD structure. Rejected because it loses the strategic design benefits of DDD and doesn't scale well for complex domains.

### Hybrid Approach (Functional Services + OOP Entities)
Keeping mutable entities but implementing services functionally. Rejected because it doesn't address the core issues with mutable state and creates inconsistency in the codebase.

## Scope

### Bounded Context
- **Primary**: Core Scopes Domain - scope management, hierarchy, and operations
- **Secondary**: Application Services - use case implementations and error handling

### Components
- **Domain Layer**: All entities, value objects, domain services, and repository interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, command/query handlers, and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations (return Result types)
- **Presentation Layer**: Error handling and response mapping

### External Systems
- **Database Operations**: Repository implementations will use Result types for database operations
- **File System**: Any file operations will use functional error handling patterns

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Implement Result<T, E> or Either<L, R> type
2. Create functional error handling utilities
3. Establish patterns for function composition

### Phase 2: Domain Refactoring
1. Convert domain services to pure functions
2. Implement functional repository interfaces
3. Update use cases to use Result types

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Update presentation layer to handle Result types
2. Migrate infrastructure implementations
3. Update error handling throughout the application

### Phase 4: Advanced Patterns
1. Implement domain event handling functionally
2. Explore functional reactive patterns for complex workflows
3. Consider functional state management approaches

### Code Style Guidelines
- Use `data class` for immutable domain objects
- Prefer `sealed class` for domain states and commands
- Use extension functions for domain behavior
- Implement operators for Result type composition
- Follow railway-oriented programming patterns for error handling
