# ADR 0014: Pluggable AI Strategy Pattern

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Building on [ADR 0012: Generic Entity Lifecycle Context](0012-generic-entity-lifecycle-context.md), we need to enable AI capabilities for all entity types while respecting their unique characteristics.

Each entity type has distinct AI interaction needs:
- **Scopes**: Task breakdown, priority optimization, hierarchy analysis
- **User Preferences**: Usage pattern analysis, accessibility recommendations
- **Project Templates**: Structure optimization, completeness analysis
- **Future Entities**: Unknown requirements that must be accommodatable

The challenge is balancing:
1. **Generic Infrastructure**: Reusable AI capabilities across all entities
2. **Domain Specificity**: Entity-specific intelligence and optimizations
3. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new entity types without modifying core
4. **Consistency**: Uniform user experience for AI interactions

## Decision

We will implement a **Pluggable AI Strategy Pattern** that separates generic AI infrastructure from entity-specific intelligence.

### Core Design

The pattern consists of three layers:

1. **Generic AI Infrastructure** (Shared)
   - Proposal lifecycle management
   - User review workflows
   - Attribution and auditing
   - Version-based testing
   - Learning from feedback

2. **Strategy Interface** (Contract)
   - Standard methods for entity analysis
   - Proposal generation interface
   - Validation contracts
   - Feedback incorporation

3. **Entity-Specific Strategies** (Pluggable)
   - Domain knowledge encoding
   - Custom analysis logic
   - Specialized proposal types
   - Entity-specific validation

### Key Principles

1. **Open/Closed Principle**: New entity types can be added without modifying existing code

2. **Strategy Registration**: Strategies self-register during application startup

3. **Capability Discovery**: AI agents can query what entity types they can work with

4. **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional even if specific strategies fail

5. **Learning Loop**: Strategies can evolve based on user feedback

### Integration with Entity Lifecycle

The AI strategies work with:
- **Entity Snapshots**: Analyze complete entity state at a point in time
- **Change Proposals**: Generate EntityChange objects as proposals
- **Version Testing**: Use entity versioning for safe proposal testing
- **Attribution System**: All AI actions are properly attributed

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Extensibility**: New entity types get AI support by adding a strategy
- **Maintainability**: Entity-specific logic isolated in dedicated strategies
- **Reusability**: Common AI patterns can be shared across strategies
- **Evolution**: Individual strategies can evolve independently
- **Testing**: Each strategy can be tested in isolation

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer to understand
- **Coordination**: Strategy interface changes affect all implementations
- **Discovery**: Need mechanism for strategies to register themselves
- **Quality Variance**: AI quality may vary between entity types

### Neutral
- **Performance**: Strategy routing adds minimal overhead
- **Documentation**: Each strategy needs its own documentation
- **Governance**: Need process for strategy quality standards

## Architecture Patterns

### Strategy Discovery
Strategies are discovered through:
1. **Compile-time Registration**: Dependency injection
2. **Runtime Registration**: Plugin system
3. **Convention-based**: Naming patterns
4. **Annotation-based**: Marked classes

### Proposal Workflow
1. User or system triggers AI analysis
2. System routes to appropriate strategy
3. Strategy analyzes entity and generates proposals
4. Proposals enter review workflow
5. User decisions feed back to strategy

### MCP Integration
External AI agents integrate through:
1. MCP server exposes entity data
2. External agent uses same strategy interface
3. Proposals flow through standard workflow
4. Attribution tracks external agent identity

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic AI Service**: Single service knows all entity types
   - Rejected: Violates Open/Closed, becomes unmaintainable

2. **Per-Context AI**: Each context implements own AI
   - Rejected: Duplication, inconsistent experience

3. **Pure Generic AI**: No entity-specific knowledge
   - Rejected: Poor quality suggestions, limited value

4. **AI Microservices**: Separate service per entity type
   - Rejected: Operational complexity, network overhead

- [ADR 0002: AI-Driven Development](0002-ai-driven-development-architecture.md) - Overall AI strategy
- [ADR 0008: Clean Architecture](0008-clean-architecture-adoption.md) - Plugin architecture patterns

## Implementation Notes

The strategy pattern will be implemented using:
- Service discovery for strategy registration
- Standard interfaces in the shared kernel
- Entity-specific implementations in each context
- Central registry for strategy management

Detailed implementation patterns are documented separately.
